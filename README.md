# Evil and Sensible
This is an Emacs starter kit I've created that I'd recommend to anyone with Vim-experience who's looking to try Emacs.

## Details:
- easy to read and modify configuration file.
- sensible default settings.
- no custom keybindings set.
- many high-quality packages for you to discover and use (see the `use-package setup` section).
- a comprehensive `.gitignore`.
